**I am on the industrial job market. I'm looking for distributed systems and infrastructure as well as software engineering positions.**



I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Penn State University, advised by [Prof. George Kesidis](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/).

<i>My research goal is to make distributed systems more efficient in terms of cost, performance, and security.</i>

My broad research interests include distributed systems and cloud computing -- in particular, I am interested in performance evaluation and designing efficient (in terms of cost, performance and security) cloud platforms and also systems problems associated with resource management and scheduling.

I graduated from Sharif University of Technology in 2017 with a BS in Computer Engineering where I worked on performance evaluation of modern storage systems.

For more information you can see my CV [here](https://mrata.github.io/files/ata-cv.pdf).
