I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Penn State University, advised by [Prof. Grorge Kesidis](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/). I've also worked closely with [Prof. Timothy Zhu](https://sites.psu.edu/timothyz/) and [Prof. Bhuvan Urgaonkar](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~bhuvan).

My broad research interests include distributed systems and cloud computing -- in particular, I am interested in performance evaluation and designing efficient cloud platforms and also systems problems associated with resource management and scheduling.

I graduated from Sharif University of Technology in 2017 with a BS in Computer Engineering where I worked on performance evaluation of modern storage systems.
